## **Hardware/Electronics**

Our biosensor utilizes a range of high-performance components to achieve its functionality:

- **STM32WB55VG:** This is a dual-core, multi-protocol and ultra-low-power 2.4 GHz MCU system on chip. It is the brain of our sensor and responsible for data processing and wireless communication.

- **MLPF-WB55-01E3:** This is an integrated filter module for STM32WB55. It enhances the wireless reliability and performance of our sensor.

- **BQ51052BYFP:** This is a high-efficiency, Qi-compliant wireless power receiver. It enables our sensor to be charged wirelessly.

- **TLV75533PDRV:** This is a low-dropout (LDO) regulator with high power-supply rejection ratio (PSRR). It helps to provide stable power supply for our sensor.

- **KTD2052:** This is an LED driver used for status indication in our sensor.

- **LSM6DSV16XTR:** This is a system-in-package featuring a 3D digital accelerometer and a 3D digital gyroscope. It enables our sensor to detect and log movements.
